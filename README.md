# Sopity-ad-free
The spotify ad-free.py file contains a python code which simply turns off the volume as soon as the code finds an ad playing.
The code uses three main libraries selenium, BeautifulSoup and pycaw, make sure you install them before executing the code.
Also make sure to download chrome drivers before running the code. Here's the download link: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
Enjoy uninterupted music.
